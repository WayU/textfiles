It was a crisp autumn night when the Johnson family decided to take their RV out for a weekend trip. Sean, the father, had recently retired from his job and wanted to use the weekend away to bond with his two sons and longtime wife, Jan. Neither Sean or Jan could have anticipated how quickly their getaway would turn into an unimaginable nightmare of terror.

As the Johnson family drove down the dark and winding road, their headlights illuminated shadows between the colorful trees. Partially hidden from sight was a decrepit, dilapidated cabin. The structure was hardly recognizable as a cabin, with its windows boarded up and the door barely hanging together. Thick, gnarled vines had started to wrap around the cabin and it seemed to almost be trapped in a time-bubble.

Though the family felt uneasy, they decided it would be best to just keep driving and not investigate any further. Suddenly, their engine stopped and the RV came to a sudden halt. Jan screamed out in terror, while her two teenage boys scrambled out of their seats to investigate the situation.

A hooded figure suddenly appeared in front of the RV and began to slowly walk towards them. The Johnsons were in awe, their adrenaline pumping as the figure slowly approached. The figure was shrouded in a long, dark cloak and had its hands covered in a pair of black leather gloves. It crept up to the RV and paused for a moment, peering in through one of the RV's windows with a wise, yellow gaze.

The figure then began to slowly circle the RV, its heavy breathing echoing loudly against the still night air. Sean told the family to stay calm and keep the windows shut, while he quickly tried to start the engine again. Suddenly the RV started to shake, as if someone were trying to hurl the entire thing off the road.

For a moment, the Johnsons thought they were safe. But suddenly the door of the RV swung open and the hooded figure entered, revealing an aged face and a set of red, piercing eyes. Without saying a word, the figure let out an animalistic roar and pointed an old and worn finger at Jan. The figure started to cackle as Jan screamed."

She quickly grabbed the two children and ran, but the figure moved with supernatural speed and blocked her path. Jan pleaded for them to be released, but the figure simply laughed, revealing a mouth full of yellow, broken teeth.

Jan felt the cold hands of the figure tighten around her throat, and everything started to fade away into darkness. Sean and the boys heard Jan's screams from the RV and immediately ran out to help, but it was too late. When they reached the hooded figure, Jan was already gone, her neck had been snapped and her body lay lifeless on the ground.

The hooded figure then turned its attention to Sean and the boys, who were frozen in fear. They could see that the figure was not human, but some sort of demon or creature from another world. The demon let out another deafening roar and lunged towards the group.

Sean and the boys ran for their lives, their hearts pounding in their chest. They didn't know where to go or what to do, but they knew they had to get away from the demon. They ran through the woods, dodging trees and jumping over fallen logs. They could hear the demon's howls getting closer and closer, but they didn't look back.

They finally reached the main road and saw a car approaching in the distance. They flagged it down, and the driver stopped to help them. They frantically explained what had happened, and the driver immediately called the police.

The police arrived quickly, and they searched the woods for the demon, but they couldn't find it. They found Jan's body and the RV, but there was no sign of the demon. The Johnsons were in shock, they couldn't believe what had happened. They had lost Jan, and they would never be the same again.

The Johnsons were never able to fully explain what had happened that night. The police couldn't find any evidence of the demon, and they eventually ruled Jan's death as an accident. But the Johnsons knew the truth, and they would always remember that terrifying night when a demon took Jan from them.
